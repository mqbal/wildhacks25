# FoodOnTheGo

## About the Project

We came up with this project because we remember the struggles of trying to get food before class. Sometimes classes are too far and planning out whether or not we would be able to grab food would be difficult. So, we created a campus based food planner where students are able to put their schedule in and plan out what restaurants they can stop by to get food.


## Built with

We decided to create this website using React, Python, Flask, and more. Also, we attempted to incorporate some of the software presented at the hackathon such as Auth0, MongoDb and Gemini API.
